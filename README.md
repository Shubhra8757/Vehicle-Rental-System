# Vehicle-Rental-System
The Vehicle Rental System is a software application that allows users to browse, book, and manage vehicle rentals efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for customers to register, log in, and explore available vehicles based on their type, such as cars, bikes, or vans. Users can select vehicles, specify rental dates, and complete bookings, with the system calculating total costs automatically.

The system also includes administrative features for managing vehicle inventories, availability, and bookings. Additionally, users can view their booking history and easily log out after use. It aims to streamline the rental process, ensure customer satisfaction, and provide accurate rental details while preventing errors through validation checks.
